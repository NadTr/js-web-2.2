To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-2.2/)


## The exercise: **Beer displayer**

Use the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to make an application that displays beers. For each beer it should display its name, tagline, its year of first brewery and its image.

Each beer should be presented in a rectangle and multiple rectangles should be shown on the same line. The application should be responsive.
